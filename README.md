## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

Sportz is a comprehensive backend service designed for live sports coverage, utilizing REST endpoints for match and commentary management alongside WebSockets for real-time data broadcasting. The platform allows clients to monitor match lists and receive instantaneous score and play-by-play commentary updates through a robust streaming architecture that features heartbeats, rate limiting, and backpressure protection. By enforcing live-only updates and utilizing Zod schemas for strict input validation, Sportz ensures a reliable and structured flow of information; additionally, the service includes dedicated seeding tools to simulate live game environments and facilitate development.

👉 **Input Validation**: Ensure data integrity across both REST endpoints and WebSocket messages using strict Zod schemas.

👉 **Seed Tooling**: Rapidly populate matches and simulate live commentary and score changes with a dedicated script designed for testing and simulation.

And many more, including code architecture and reusability.

## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajpratap29/websocket-10ms-broadcast-core.git
cd sportz
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=

# Port & Host
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Arcjet
ARCJET_KEY=""
ARCJET_ENV="development"

# API URL
API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
# API_URL="YOUR_REAL_PRODUCTION_URL"

BROADCAST="1"
DELAY_MS="250"
MATCH_COUNT="0"
```

Replace the placeholder values with your real credentials.

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to view the project.

Server runs at:

- HTTP: http://localhost:8000
- WS: ws://localhost:8000/ws

**Scripts**

- `npm run dev` — start server with watch mode
- `npm run seed` — seed DB with a basic match + commentary entry

## REST API

### List matches

`GET /matches?limit=50`

### Create match

`POST /matches`

```json
{
  "sport": "football",
  "homeTeam": "FC Neon",
  "awayTeam": "Drizzle United",
  "startTime": "2025-02-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2025-02-01T13:45:00.000Z"
}
```

Allowed status values: `scheduled`, `live`, `finished`.

Status is computed from `startTime` and `endTime`.

### List commentary for a match

`GET /matches/:id/commentary?limit=100`

### Create commentary for a match

`POST /matches/:id/commentary`

```json
{
  "minute": 42,
  "sequence": 120,
  "period": "2nd half",
  "eventType": "goal",
  "actor": "Alex Morgan",
  "team": "FC Neon",
  "message": "GOAL! Powerful finish from the edge of the box.",
  "metadata": { "assist": "Sam Kerr" },
  "tags": ["goal", "shot"]
}
```

## WebSocket Protocol

Connect:

`ws://localhost:8000/ws`

Optional auto-subscribe on connect:

`ws://localhost:8000/ws?matchId=123`

### Client → Server

```json
{ "type": "subscribe", "matchId": 123 }
```

```json
{ "type": "unsubscribe", "matchId": 123 }
```

```json
{ "type": "setSubscriptions", "matchIds": [1, 2, 3] }
```

```json
{ "type": "ping" }
```

### Server → Client

```json
{ "type": "welcome" }
```

```json
{ "type": "subscribed", "matchId": 123 }
```

```json
{ "type": "unsubscribed", "matchId": 123 }
```

```json
{ "type": "subscriptions", "matchIds": [1, 2, 3] }
```

```json
{ "type": "commentary", "data": { "id": 1, "matchId": 123, "message": "..." } }
```

```json
{ "type": "pong" }
```

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "code": "match_not_found",
  "message": "Match 999 not found",
  "matchIds": [999]
}
```

### Limits

- Max subscriptions per socket: 50
- Rate limit: 20 burst, 10 messages/sec
- Max message payload: 1 MB
- Backpressure: closes if buffered > 1 MB

## Notes

- Auth is intentionally omitted to keep focus on WS mechanics.
- For multi-instance scaling, use pub/sub (Redis/NATS/Kafka) so broadcasts
  reach all WS servers.
